## Theory
A formal language is a set of strings formed from a finite alphabet according to specific rules. Unlike natural languages, formal languages have precise definitions suitable for mathematical analysis and computation.
A formal grammar consists of non-terminal symbols, terminal symbols, a start symbol, and production rules. Grammars generate strings by starting from the start symbol and applying production rules until only terminals remain.
A finite automaton recognizes strings by processing input symbols through state transitions. It accepts a string if it ends in a final state after consuming all input. Regular grammars can be directly converted to finite automata, establishing equivalence between generative and recognitive approaches.


## Objectives:

* Discover what a language is and what it needs to have to be considered a formal one;
* Provide the initial setup for the evolving project;
* According to the variant number, get the grammar definition and do the following <br>
  a. Implement a type/class for your grammar; <br>
  b. Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the language expressed by your given grammar; <br>
  c. Implement some functionality that would convert an object of type Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton; <br>
  d. For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an input string can be obtained via the state transition from it.

## Implementation description

The Grammar class stores the grammar components: non-terminals {S, D, E, J}, terminals {a, b, c, d, e}, start symbol "S", and production rules in a HashMap for efficient access.

```java
public Grammar() {
    nonTerminals = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("S", "D", "E", "J"));
    terminals = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"));
    startSymbol = "S";
    productions = new HashMap<>();
    productions.put("S", Arrays.asList("aD"));
    productions.put("D", Arrays.asList("dE", "bJ", "aE"));
    productions.put("J", Arrays.asList("cS"));
    productions.put("E", Arrays.asList("e", "aE"));
}
```

The generateString() method starts from the start symbol and randomly selects production rules, appending terminals and following non-terminals until derivation completes.

```java
public String generateString() {
    String current = startSymbol;
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    while (nonTerminals.contains(current)) {
        List<String> rules = productions.get(current);
        String rule = rules.get(random.nextInt(rules.size()));
        result.append(rule.charAt(0));
        if (rule.length() == 2) {
            current = String.valueOf(rule.charAt(1));
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```

The conversion maps each nonterminal to a state and creates transitions according to production rules. Productions ending with non-terminals transition to that state; terminal-only productions go to a final state "F".

```java
public FiniteAutomaton toFiniteAutomaton() {
    Set<String> states = new HashSet<>(nonTerminals);
    states.add("F");
    Map<String, Map<String, Set<String>>> transitions = new HashMap<>();
    for (String state : productions.keySet()) {
        for (String rule : productions.get(state)) {
            String symbol = String.valueOf(rule.charAt(0));
            String nextState = (rule.length() == 2) ? 
                String.valueOf(rule.charAt(1)) : "F";
            transitions.get(state).get(symbol).add(nextState);
        }
    }
    return new FiniteAutomaton(states, terminals, transitions, 
        startSymbol, new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("F")));
}
```

The automaton tracks all possible current states, processes each input character by computing reachable next states, and accepts if any final state is reached.
Strings like "ade" and "aae" are accepted because they follow valid derivation paths (S -> aD -> ade, S -> aD -> aE -> aae), while invalid strings are correctly rejected. The grammar-to-automaton conversion preserves the language definition, confirming the equivalence between the two representations.

This laboratory work successfully implemented the core concepts of formal language theory. The Grammar class generates valid strings through random application of production rules, while the FiniteAutomaton class recognizes whether strings belong to the language. The conversion between these two representations preserves the language definition, confirming their theoretical equivalence.
